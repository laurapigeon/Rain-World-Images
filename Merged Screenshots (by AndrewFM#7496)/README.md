## Merged Screenshots of the Rain World
**Originally by AndrewFM**

In-game screenshots of all rooms in Rain World. Rooms which consist of multiple screens are merged together into a single image.
Room screenshots are unpopulated - slugcat, overseers, and creatures will not appear in any of them (though there are some exceptions like echoes, guardians, etc.)

### Downpour
Because the Downpour merged screenshots are over 1.5x the size of this entire repository even after being compressed as much as possible, they are being stored in another repository. This prevents one from having to download all of that data if they only want another section of this repository. It also makes it easier to remove the old versions from the history to prevent one from having to download some multiple of the amount of space they take up due to the old ones being in the history.
